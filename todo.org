* To discuss as group
*** DONE [#B] How to implement all combos of (real/generated) and
    CLOSED: [2019-04-18 Thu 18:10]
    (positive/negative) samples for the dtor dataset classes
**** Assigned to: Anish
      Like I said my understanding of GANs comes from the original paper which
      I don't think really addresses this, so I feel like I might be missing
      some of the picture here. What I have now should be at least somewhat
      adequate though
*** DONE [#B] Talk about the content discriminator
    CLOSED: [2019-04-16 Tue 16:24]
    I'm not convinced that the content discriminator is gonna work: I had to
    come up with the arch myself, as I couldn't find anything for this online
    I think we might be better off enforcing content similarity by using a
    resnet connection across the generator :( -Anish
    * ARDA: Use Speech2Text for content loss? https://github.com/awni/speech

**** Solution: We're just gonna use the resnet way for now
* Other todo stuff
*** DONE [#A] Write generator trainer (ie whole training loop)
    CLOSED: [2019-04-18 Thu 18:10]
   * ARDA/ANISH need to collaborate on this one.
*** DONE [#A] Write dataloaders for the discriminator classes?
    CLOSED: [2019-04-15 Mon 22:11]
**** Assigned to: Anish
    I don't think there's actually much to do here, the main annoyance is just
    that the data for content/identity can be variable-length so I can't
    actually pass arround batches as tensors (so each "batch" probably has to
    consist of a single example? Not sure how that interacts with SGD though)
**** Solution: Literally just set batch_size to 1 for content/identity dtors
     and things should work
   * ARDA: We should consider padding instead.
*** DONE [#A] Validate the train_discriminator code in
    CLOSED: [2019-04-16 Tue 22:35]
    discriminators/common.py
**** Assigned to: Can't be Anish
     I found the basic structure online: would appreciate a review, since
     this is an absolutely critical function...
*** DONE [#B] Make Dataset classes, train_dtor handle data labels?
    CLOSED: [2019-04-15 Mon 22:39]
**** Assigned to: Anish
     Depends on the outcome of the discussion on "how to implement all combos"

*** DONE Implement stylevec_for_person by averaging over samples
    CLOSED: [2019-04-16 Tue 17:36]
* Simple stuff
*** TODO In isvoice_dtor decide on max vs average pooling
*** DONE In isvoice_dtor should I return scalar instead of 1d tensor?
    CLOSED: [2019-04-16 Tue 22:35]
*** TODO Decide on actual hyperparameters in the various
    get_discriminator functions
*** TODO Decide on which identity_dtor mode to use
*** DONE Apparently way that dataloaders interact w/ labels is magic?
    CLOSED: [2019-04-16 Tue 22:35]
    See https://stanford.edu/~shervine/blog/pytorch-how-to-generate-data-parallel
*** DONE How to take care of multiple GPUs in train loop? Do we even care?
    CLOSED: [2019-04-16 Tue 17:36]

* Final todo stuff (Thursday)
** Load trained style embedder into ProjectModel
** Proper filename handling on checkpointers [Anish]
** Arda expects time in the WRONG axis

* Todo items (friday night pow-wow)
** TODO Proper filename handling on checkpoints
*** Probably done?
** DONE Axis compatibility between Anish/Joel/Arda/Alex
